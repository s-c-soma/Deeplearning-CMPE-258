EXTRA points assignment - to catchup bad scores in quiz and midterm 
submit all artifacts in github directory under Assignment 7. Please write up proper read.me file explaining the artifacts

 

a) Build an end2end application using tensorflow.js including training and validation on the browser (Eg: please refer to rock paper scissors or drawing apps links in the slides)

 

b) Write a colab to do mnist classification using RNNs where you are passing MNIST image data row by row to rnns

(Hint : https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn (Links to an external site.) and https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/snapshot-keras/site/en/guide/keras/rnn.ipynb#scrollTo=18a254dfaa73 or  (Links to an external site.)   https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-regression#0) 

 

 

c)  Build an android studio app using tflite model  for a simple colab based trained keras model usecase.  (Hint : https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/recognize-flowers-with-tensorflow-on-android#0 (Links to an external site.)) 

checkin all the artifacts and screenshots and record a simple demo 

 

d) Use a pre trained tensorflow.js model in browser and build a full app

Example : https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-object-detection#0 (Links to an external site.)

e) Build a timeseries forcasting model using RNN

 

Example : https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/structured_data/time_series.ipynb#scrollTo=pa49bUnKyRgF (Links to an external site.)
