You will demonstrate simple hello world examples end 2 end with automl tools on google cloud platform -

Note: this assignment has 20 points - not the regular 10 points.

 

this assignment has two parts

 

Link to the samples you will replicate (with your optional but important creative modifications - like either use different data sets or building your own data set by labelling and collecting from images.google.com or something else that you think you can do (or may be even taking pictures using ur mobile phone cameras), different target labels, different tuning configurations s to automl etc.,. - i challenge the students to take on interesting twists to these hello world examples  ) and produce results

 

Part 1:

 

https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs/tutorials (Links to an external site.)

 

Five examples - one in each of below categories. 

Hello AI Platform (Unified) 
Hello image data
Use an image dataset to train an AutoML model.

Hello text data
Use a text dataset to train an AutoML model.

Hello video data
Use a video dataset to train an AutoML model.

Hello custom training
Learn how to bring your own code to AI Platform, by using a sample app to train an image recognition model.

Hello structured data
Use a structured dataset to train an AutoML model.

Note that you should choose very limited compute and are not expected to have state of art models - but just a model which shows loss is going in downward direction.
There are lot of possibilities

https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs/start/automl-model-types (Links to an external site.)

 

and you can pick and chose

Part 2:

Execute automl vision and timeseries forcasting models

a) https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/automl-vision-edge-in-mlkit#0 (Links to an external site.)

 

end2end deployment of a vision model using automl to mobile device

b) https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/time-series-forecasting-with-cloud-ai-platform#0 (Links to an external site.)

 

Deliverables :

a) All artifacts for the above assignments checked in github in appropriate directory structure

 

b) 10 minute video and presentation/demo for each part (either live or with screenshots of your setup) explaining what you did for each of the parts and showing final results.

 

Note: if you want to do automl in another platform like H2O or any other place, that is also fine. but it should be complete. 

 

I would like to have students challenge themselves by implementing more and more complicated and advanced features of google automl platform.

 

You are not limited to just these above assignment. You can show case more automl models for more extra points if you are interested in to score extra points.

 

Put a proper read.me in github to ensure you highlight what you did above and beyond what i asked for so we can score for extra points.
